    "In this notebook, you:\n",
    "1. Author a multi-agent system using LangGraph.\n",
    "1. Wrap the LangGraph agent with MLflow `ResponsesAgent` to ensure compatibility with Databricks features.\n",
    "1. Manually test the multi-agent system's output.\n",
    "1. Log and deploy the multi-agent system.\n",

    "\n",
    "Multi-agent systems consist of multiple AI agents working together, each with specialized capabilities. As one of those agents, Genie allows users to interact with their structured data using natural language. Unlike SQL functions which can only run pre-defined queries, Genie has the flexibility to create novel queries to answer user questions.\n",

    "- Address all `TODO`s in this notebook.\n",
    "- Create a Genie Space, see Databricks documentation ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/genie/set-up) | [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/genie/set-up))."

    "- **GenieAgent**: A LangChain runnable that allows you to easily interact with your Genie Space to query structured data.\n",
    "- **Custom serving agent**: An agent that is already hosted as an existing endpoint on Databricks.\n",
    "- **In-code tool-calling agent**: An agent that calls Unity Catalog function tools, defined within this notebook. This example uses `system.ai.python_exec`, but for examples of other tools you can add to your agents, see Databricks documentation ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/generative-ai/agent-framework/agent-tool) | [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/generative-ai/agent-framework/agent-tool)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The supervisor agent is responsible for creating and routing tool calls to each of your subagents, passing only the context necessary. You can modify this behavior and pass along the entire message history if desired. See the [LangGraph docs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/supervisor/) for more information.\n",
