    "This notebook contains the SQL DDL statements to create all 10 customer behavior analytics metric views in Databricks.\n",

    "**Catalog/Schema:** `juan_dev.retail`  \n",
    "**Purpose:** Pre-aggregated KPIs for Customer Behavior Genie Room  \n",
    "**Created:** 2025-01-29\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Metric views provide pre-aggregated KPIs that improve query performance and ensure consistent calculations across the Genie room's question types. Each metric view defines:\n",
    "- **Dimensions**: Attributes for grouping and filtering (e.g., Segment, Channel, Product Category)\n",
    "- **Measures**: Pre-defined aggregations (e.g., Customer Count, Avg CLTV, Transaction Count)\n",
    "- **Source Data**: The underlying tables and transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Execute each cell in order to create the metric views. Metric views use the `WITH METRICS` syntax and YAML language for defining dimensions and measures.\n"
