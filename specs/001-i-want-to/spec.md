## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06

- Q: When multiple customers attempt to purchase limited inventory for the same product at the same location on the same day, how should allocation work? ‚Üí A: Random allocation (simulate real-world randomness)
- Q: What is the target stockout frequency to maintain realism in the synthetic data? ‚Üí A: Occasional (5-10% of product-location-day combinations)
- Q: Should demand forecasts influence inventory replenishment timing in the synthetic data? ‚Üí A: No, replenishments follow fixed schedule independent of forecasts
- Q: Should product returns immediately replenish inventory and enable additional sales on the same day? ‚Üí A: Delayed replenishment (returns add to inventory 1-3 days later)
- Q: When demand spikes during peak seasons exceed inventory capacity, what cart abandonment rate increase is realistic? ‚Üí A: 10%

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Data scientists and analysts need synthetic data that realistically represents retail operations where customer purchases directly impact inventory levels and inventory availability influences purchasing patterns. The current synthetic data generation creates customer behavior and inventory data independently, leading to unrealistic scenarios where customers purchase products that should be out of stock or inventory levels don't reflect sales activity.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a product has zero inventory at a specific location on a specific date, **When** customer transactions are generated for that date and location, **Then** no sales should occur for that product at that location unless inventory is replenished

2. **Given** customer purchase transactions occur for a product at a location, **When** inventory snapshots are generated for subsequent dates, **Then** inventory quantities should reflect the depletion from those sales

3. **Given** a customer segment (e.g., VIP customers) has specific purchasing patterns, **When** they attempt to purchase high-demand products, **Then** inventory availability should be factored into whether the transaction completes successfully

4. **Given** multiple customers attempt to purchase the same product at the same location on the same day, **When** the available inventory is limited, **Then** the total quantity sold should not exceed available inventory and allocation is randomly distributed among purchase attempts

5. **Given** inventory levels are low for a product, **When** customer behavior events are generated (browsing, adding to cart), **Then** cart abandonment rates should increase by 10 percentage points above baseline

6. **Given** the complete dataset is generated, **When** analyzing stockout occurrences, **Then** between 5-10% of product-location-day combinations should show zero available inventory

7. **Given** demand forecasts predict high demand for a product, **When** inventory replenishment events are generated, **Then** replenishment timing follows a fixed schedule regardless of forecast values

8. **Given** a customer returns a product on day N, **When** inventory is updated, **Then** the returned quantity is added back to available inventory 1-3 days after the return date (day N+1 to N+3)

9. **Given** peak seasonal demand (Black Friday, holidays) exceeds inventory capacity, **When** cart abandonment events are generated, **Then** abandonment rates increase by 10 percentage points compared to normal periods

### Edge Cases

- What happens when seasonal demand spikes (Black Friday, holidays) exceed inventory capacity for popular products? Stockouts occur and are recorded; excess demand results in lost sales opportunities; cart abandonment increases by 10 percentage points.
- How does the system handle products transitioning between in-stock and out-of-stock states multiple times during a single day? Not supported; inventory changes occur at daily granularity.
- What happens when warehouse transfers occur - should they affect purchasing patterns at destination locations? Out of scope for initial implementation.
- How are digital channel purchases handled when inventory is tracked at physical warehouse locations? Digital purchases draw from warehouse inventory as specified in FR-008.
- What happens with returns - should they immediately replenish inventory and potentially enable additional sales? Returns replenish inventory with 1-3 day delay as clarified.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST ensure that customer purchase transactions do not exceed available inventory quantities for a given product, location, and date combination

- **FR-002**: System MUST update inventory levels to reflect depletion from customer purchases in chronological order

- **FR-003**: System MUST generate out-of-stock events and track stockout occurrences when inventory reaches zero for any product-location combination

- **FR-004**: System MUST increase cart abandonment rates by 10 percentage points above baseline when inventory levels are low or zero for requested products

- **FR-005**: System MUST respect the temporal sequence where inventory must exist before it can be sold (purchases cannot precede inventory availability)

- **FR-006**: System MUST allocate limited inventory randomly among competing purchase attempts, without regard to customer segment priority

- **FR-007**: System MUST generate realistic inventory movement patterns that account for both sales depletion and replenishment activities

- **FR-008**: System MUST handle channel-specific inventory scenarios where digital purchases draw from warehouse inventory and store purchases draw from store inventory

- **FR-009**: System MUST generate customer behavioral indicators (browsing without purchase, cart abandonment) that correlate with low or zero inventory states

- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain consistency between sales fact records and inventory fact records for the same product-location-date combinations

- **FR-011**: System MUST generate stockout events such that 5-10% of all product-location-day combinations experience zero available inventory

- **FR-012**: System MUST generate demand forecast data that reflects the relationship between predicted demand and actual inventory constraints, while inventory replenishment timing follows a fixed schedule independent of forecast predictions

- **FR-013**: System MUST process product returns such that returned quantities are added back to available inventory 1-3 days after the return transaction date

- **FR-014**: System MUST record excess demand during stockout periods as lost sales opportunities for analytics purposes

- **FR-015**: System MUST increase cart abandonment rates by 10 percentage points during peak seasonal demand periods when inventory capacity is exceeded

### Key Entities

- **Customer Transaction**: Represents a purchase attempt or completed purchase by a customer, linked to specific products, quantities, locations, dates, and channels. Must validate against available inventory. Includes return transactions which trigger delayed inventory replenishment.

- **Inventory Snapshot**: Represents the state of inventory for a product at a location on a specific date, including quantities on hand, available, reserved, in transit, and damaged. Must reflect cumulative impact of sales and replenishments. Updates occur at daily granularity.

- **Product**: The item being sold and tracked in inventory, with attributes like category, brand, price, and season that influence both demand patterns and inventory management strategies.

- **Location**: Physical stores, warehouses, or distribution centers where inventory is held and from which sales are fulfilled.

- **Customer Segment**: Groups of customers (VIP, premium, loyal, regular, new) with distinct purchasing behaviors that may interact differently with inventory constraints.

- **Inventory Movement**: Records of inventory changes including receipts, transfers, sales depletion, returns (with 1-3 day processing delay), and adjustments that explain inventory level transitions. Replenishments occur on a fixed schedule regardless of demand forecasts.

- **Stockout Event**: A record indicating when and for how long a product was unavailable at a location, impacting both customer experience and sales metrics. Includes tracking of lost sales opportunities during stockout periods.

- **Cart Abandonment Event**: Records when customers add products to cart but do not complete purchase. Baseline abandonment rates increase by 10 percentage points when inventory is low or during peak demand periods with capacity constraints.
