# Inventory Operations
An inventory manager would typically ask the following types of questions about this data set, focusing on operational efficiency, stock health, and movement patterns:


- **Location Performance**
  > How does inventory distribution vary across stores ( warehouses, and regions) ?
  - Which locations have the highest or lowest inventory turnover?
  > Are there locations with consistently high stockouts or overstock rates?

- **Stock Levels & Health**
  - What is the average days of supply and stock cover for each location or category?
  - Which products or categories are at risk of stockout or overstock?
  - What is the current inventory value by location, category, or region?
  - How many SKUs are below their reorder point and need replenishment?

- **Movement & Supply Chain**
  - What are the most common types and reasons for inventory movements (e.g., receipts, transfers, returns, adjustments)?
  - What are the top movement flows between locations (e.g., warehouse to store, store to store)?
  - Are there any bottlenecks or delays in inventory transfers or receipts?
  - How many units are being moved, and what is the value of these movements by flow or region?

- **Accuracy & Adjustments**
  - How many inventory adjustments are being made, and what are the main reasons?
  - What percentage of adjustments are positive (gains) vs. negative (losses)?
  - Are there patterns in returns or adjustments that indicate process issues?

- **Operational KPIs**
  - What is the sell-through rate for key products or categories?
  - How does inventory investment compare to sales performance?
  - What is the return rate and adjustment rate for each location or category?

- **Supply Chain Efficiency**
  - How efficient are receipts and transfers (e.g., volume, frequency)?
  - Are there any regions or flows with high return or adjustment rates?
  - What is the average movement size and value by type and flow?

These questions help inventory managers optimize stock levels, reduce costs, improve fulfillment, and identify operational issues using the available data set.
