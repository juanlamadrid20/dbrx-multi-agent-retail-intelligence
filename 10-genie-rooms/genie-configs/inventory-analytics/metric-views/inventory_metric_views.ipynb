    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the SQL DDL statements to create all 10 inventory analytics metric views in Databricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Catalog/Schema:** `juan_dev.retail`  \n",
    "**Purpose:** Pre-aggregated KPIs for Inventory Analytics Genie Room  \n",
    "**Created:** 2025-01-27\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Metric views provide pre-aggregated KPIs that improve query performance and ensure consistent calculations across the Genie room's 11 question types. Each metric view defines:\n",
    "- **Dimensions**: Attributes for grouping and filtering (e.g., Location, Product Category, Date)\n",
    "- **Measures**: Pre-defined aggregations (e.g., Total Quantity, Average Days of Supply, Stockout Count)\n",
    "- **Source Data**: The underlying tables and transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Execute each cell in order to create the metric views. Metric views use the `WITH METRICS` syntax and YAML language for defining dimensions and measures.\n"
