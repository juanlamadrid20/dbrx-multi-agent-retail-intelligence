# Customer Behavior
A customer behavior analyst would ask questions that help uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights about how customers interact with products, channels, and the brand. Based on the data and queries in your notebook, here are some typical questions:

Customer Segmentation & Value

What are the key customer segments, and how do their lifetime values differ?
Which segments have the highest average order value or frequency?
What is the distribution of customer lifetime value across segments?
Purchase Patterns & RFM Analysis

How frequently do customers make purchases, and how recently?
Which customers are at risk of churning, and which are the most loyal?
What is the average time between purchases for different segments?
Product & Category Affinity

Which product categories are most often purchased together?
What are the most common product pairings in a single transaction?
How does category affinity differ by customer segment?
Channel Behavior & Migration

Through which channels do customers prefer to shop?
How do customers migrate between acquisition and preferred channels over time?
What is the impact of channel on purchase frequency and value?
Engagement & Funnel Analysis

What are the conversion rates at each stage of the engagement funnel (view, cart, purchase)?
Which channels drive the most engagement and conversions?
Where are customers dropping off in the purchase funnel?
Abandonment & Recovery

What is the rate of cart abandonment, and how effective are recovery campaigns?
Which stages of the funnel have the highest abandonment rates?
What is the revenue recovery rate from abandoned carts?
Personalization & Affinity Impact

How effective are personalized recommendations in driving purchases?
Which segments respond best to personalization?
What is the predicted impact of affinity-based targeting on CLTV?
These questions help analysts identify opportunities for targeted marketing, retention strategies, product bundling, and channel optimization. They also support data-driven decision-making for improving customer experience and business outcomes.



# Inventory Operations
An inventory manager would typically ask the following types of questions about this data set, focusing on operational efficiency, stock health, and movement patterns:

- **Stock Levels & Health**
  - Which products or categories are at risk of stockout or overstock?
  - What is the current inventory value by location, category, or region?
  - How many SKUs are below their reorder point and need replenishment?
  - What is the average days of supply and stock cover for each location or category?

- **Movement & Supply Chain**
  - What are the most common types and reasons for inventory movements (e.g., receipts, transfers, returns, adjustments)?
  - What are the top movement flows between locations (e.g., warehouse to store, store to store)?
  - Are there any bottlenecks or delays in inventory transfers or receipts?
  - How many units are being moved, and what is the value of these movements by flow or region?

- **Location Performance**
  - Which locations have the highest or lowest inventory turnover?
  - How does inventory distribution vary across stores, warehouses, and regions?
  - Are there locations with consistently high stockouts or overstock rates?

- **Accuracy & Adjustments**
  - How many inventory adjustments are being made, and what are the main reasons?
  - What percentage of adjustments are positive (gains) vs. negative (losses)?
  - Are there patterns in returns or adjustments that indicate process issues?

- **Operational KPIs**
  - What is the sell-through rate for key products or categories?
  - How does inventory investment compare to sales performance?
  - What is the return rate and adjustment rate for each location or category?

- **Supply Chain Efficiency**
  - How efficient are receipts and transfers (e.g., volume, frequency)?
  - Are there any regions or flows with high return or adjustment rates?
  - What is the average movement size and value by type and flow?

These questions help inventory managers optimize stock levels, reduce costs, improve fulfillment, and identify operational issues using the available data set.
